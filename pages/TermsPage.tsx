                  <p className="text-sm">Users agree that all communication, scheduling, and monetary transactions must occur exclusively within the Sukoon platform. Sharing personal contact information—including but not limited to WhatsApp numbers, personal email addresses, Instagram/Facebook handles, or private Zoom/Skype links—is strictly prohibited.</p>

                  <p className="text-sm">Our automated security systems scan all messages for patterns resembling phone numbers or external IDs. Any attempt to lure a user off-platform will result in an <span className="font-bold">Immediate & Permanent Ban</span>. No warnings will be issued. Any pending earnings or session credits will be forfeited immediately upon violation.</p>

                  <p className="text-sm">Sukoon cannot verify the identity or safety of individuals outside our secure ecosystem. If you choose to contact a user externally, you do so at your own risk, and Sukoon waives all liability for fraud, harassment, or misconduct that occurs off-platform.</p>

                      <li><strong>Platform Fee:</strong> Sukoon retains a flat 20% commission on every completed session fee.</li>

                      <li>Example: If you charge PKR 2,000 for a session, you earn PKR 1,600, and Sukoon retains PKR 400.</li>

                  <p className="text-sm mb-2">We operate on a 29-Day Rolling Payout Cycle. This means earnings from a session are "Cleared" for withdrawal exactly 29 days after the session is completed.</p>
                  <p className="text-sm"><strong>Why?</strong> This holding period allows us to ensure the session was conducted satisfactorily, process any disputes, and verify no fraudulent activity occurred.</p>

            <li><strong>Therapist Obligation:</strong> Therapists are legally and ethically bound to protect patient identity. Recording sessions (audio or video) or taking screenshots of text chats is a direct violation of our code of ethics.</li>
            <li><strong>Client Protection:</strong> Clients (Students) must also respect the privacy of their therapists. Sharing a therapist’s profile, private advice, or session content on social media without explicit written consent is grounds for immediate account termination.</li>
